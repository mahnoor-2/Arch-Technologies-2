ATM Simulation System (C++ | OOP)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple ATM Simulation System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The system allows users to check balance, deposit money, and withdraw money through a menu-driven interface.

✨ Features

Check current account balance

Deposit money into the account

Withdraw money with balance validation

Menu-driven user interface

Uses OOP principles for clean structure

🧠 OOP Concepts Used

Encapsulation: Balance is private inside the ATM class

Abstraction: User interacts through public methods

Constructor: Initializes account balance

💻 Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Library: <iostream>

▶️ How the Program Works

The ATM object is created with an initial balance.

The user is shown a menu:

Check Balance

Deposit Money

Withdraw Money

Exit

Based on user choice, the corresponding ATM operation is performed.

The program continues until the user selects Exit.

▶️ How to Run the Program

Open any C++ compiler (Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or online compiler)

Save the file as atm.cpp

Compile and run the program

Use the menu to perform ATM operations

🖥️ Sample Output
====== ATM MENU ======
1. Check Balance
2. Deposit Money
3. Withdraw Money
4. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Your current balance is: Rs. 5000

Enter your choice: 2
Enter amount to deposit: 1000
Rs. 1000 deposited successfully.
