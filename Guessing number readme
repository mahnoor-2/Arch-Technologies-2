Number Guessing Game (C++)
📌 Project Description

This is a simple Number Guessing Game written in C++.
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.
After each guess, the program gives a hint whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

🛠️ Features

Random number generation

User input handling

Hints for incorrect guesses

Loop continues until the correct number is guessed

🧠 How It Works

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The user enters a guess.

The program compares the guess with the secret number:

Too high → shows hint

Too low → shows hint

The game ends when the correct number is guessed.

💻 Technologies Used

Language: C++

Libraries:

<iostream>

<cstdlib>

<ctime>

▶️ How to Run the Program

Open a C++ compiler (Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or online compiler)

Copy the code into a .cpp file

Compile and run the program

Start guessing the number!

🖥️ Sample Output
I have selected a number between 1 and 100.
Try to guess it!
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 63
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.
